    <h2>Boneless rib-eye with a flavorful Italian glaze.</h2>
    <p>
      Rib eye is not a cheap cut of steak—we’ll just get that one out of the way right at the start. This grilled rib eye recipe is luxurious, it’s a
      splurge any which way you slice it. And when you shell out your hard-earned money for a fancy cut of steak, you want to be sure that you
      absolutely cook it perfectly and serve it just-so. This recipe is the only rib eye recipe you’ll ever need, if we may be so bold. With a
      high-end cut of steak like rib eye, you must resist the temptation to do anything to it—just buy a really great steak and treat it with a light
      hand. However, once you’ve got that steak perfectly grilled—and we’ll walk you through how to do that— serve it with a fresh and simple sauce
      that serves as a bright and bracing contrast to all the richness rib eye steak delivers, and you’ll be in steak dinner heaven. Plus, people can
      drizzle as much or as little of this anchovy-flecked, herby salsa verde on to their juicy steak as they’d like, so it’s a great meal for a
      crowd.
